DatBrewingCalculator
====================

A combination of each of my 'reinvention of the wheel' brewing calculators. Any new tools will be directly added
to this project and this will become the main repository for updates. The idea of this calculator was to become a
companion to brew day. Something you could run simply on a netbook or laptop and keep near your brewing area when
you need to bang out a quick calculation.

Included with DatBrewingCalculator:
- Brix conversion
- Mash temperature calculator
- Priming sugar calculator

Additions or updates:
- Brix calc should be updated to be able to estimate final gravity as well. Although this is not really what a
refractometer was designed to do, I find it to be a helpful thing to include

- A timer or stop watch type function for timing hop additons and total boil length

- ...

The ultimate goal of the project is to create a robust yet lightweight community supported brewing tool that is 
open source, and cross platform. Making this an all in one tool is something I look forward to trying to acheive.
Everything from recipe design to brewday.

Please keep in mind this is all very new territory for me and things will be done at my own pace for now. As I learn
more about the GitHub community, and python in general I look forward to expanding this project even if for nothing
more than my own entertainment and learing experience.

Lastly, I realize the name could use some work. I'm trying to think of something more interesting.
