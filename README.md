DatBrewingCalculator
====================

A combination of each of my 'reinvention of the wheel' brewing calculators. Any new tools will be directly added
to this project and this will become the main repository for updates. The idea of this calculator was to become a

Included with DatBrewingCalculator:
1. Brix conversion
2. Mash temperature calculator
3. Priming sugar calculator
